### To Do ###

Refactoring
- Levels as asset bundles
- Characters as asset bundles
- Music as asset bundles / raw files?
- check for spaghetti (check singleton usage)
- things should not know about level stuff, only interact with race classes
- implement waypoint as a race concept, things should reference that instead
- turn race manager into a state machine

Text Mesh Pro
New Input sytstem (remove old system)
Multiple controller support

Migrate to URP
- gate color should be a global shader property, instead of hooking into OnWillRenderObject

Update profiles/replays
- add version information to serialized files
- convert profile ID long to GUID
- profiles should keep track of stats separately from replays
- don't read an entire replay just to extract the header information
- support replays during a match when paused
- speed, cameras(cinemachine, players all at once, players single (cycle through), manual zoom/free camera)
- vairable replay speed
- store player profile id and name so it can be portable
- improve framework binary serialzation

General
- Outline is very expensive on UI, especially the player time...
- Difiiculy setting for levels - gate size differs based on difficulty (remove LevelConfig difficulty)
- Show player names above heads (fade in when close)
- look around (right josystick, don't know about keyboard though...)
- better guide to next waypoint (make waypoint color glow more obvious, improve direction arrow (racing line?), look at next gate button)
- Custom logo intro (in framwork, add setting to skip in settings)

Audio
- Add 3D sound for splitscreen (virtual scene for audio, duplicate audio sorce for each listener)
- Collision/sliding sound
- Player finish line sounds
- Energy gate sounds
- Waypoint engine sound
- Boost ready sound
- Full energy sound
- Victory music should differ from replay music

Characters
- Make animations more extreme
- Indicate boost ready on character
- paritcle motion trail behind racer engines (perhaps just other racers, helps see how they are moving when ahead)
- Engines spark/flash/pulse on boost fail because not enough energy
- (fatty, airbrake flaps!!!!, floating boosters fancy tech, robot, other race?, really abstract?)
- Abilities (down plummet, downwards boost, teleport)

AI
- Investigate ML agents

Levels
- Alternate paths
- need fancy visual effect for passing through a gate
- Moving gates with rotation along paths
- Improve boost gate graphics (animate the rings) - particles/screen effect to make it obvious boost was gained
- Wind zones

Level Ideas (try to think of creative hazzards)
- City
- Sky
- Desert (sandstorms)
- Factory
- Arctic (ice caves, falling ice)
- Volcano (falling rocks, magma)

### Bugs and stuff ###
Icon breaks build????????? (2019.3.0b7)
Track preview appears on top of black fade quad
Camera can clip with the gates, perhaps use a fading material when close...
What to do if a joystick disconnects in menu or game?

### Long Term ###
Multiplayer

Leaderboard
Tutorial
Level preview camera shots in menu
Ghosting

Ensure music is credited
Update level preview images
