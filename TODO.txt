### To Do ###

Fix race manager - too much wierdness potential right now
Outline is very expensive on UI, especially the player time... (TMP to fix)
Difiiculy setting for levels - gate size differs based on difficulty
expand replay state information

replays - store player profile id and name so it can be portable
replays - speed, cameras(cinemachine, players all at once, players single (cycle through), manual zoom/free camera)
replays - vairable replay speed

Multiple controller support
victory music should differ from replay music
pauser controls pause menu
Show player names above heads (fade in when close)

look around (right josystick, don't know about keyboard though...)
better guide to next waypoint (make waypoint color glow more obvious, improve direction arrow (racing line?), look at next gate button)
Engines spark on boost fail
paritcle motion trail behind engine

Collision/sliding sound
Player finish line sounds
Energy gate sounds
Waypoint engine sound
Min energy sound
Full energy sound

Characters (fatty, airbrake flaps!!!!, floating boosters fancy tech, robot, other race?, really abstract?)
Make animations more extreme
Abilities (down plummet, downwards boost, teleport)

ML agents AI

Alternate paths
Moving gates - Add rotation
Boost gates - improve graphics (animate the rings) - particles/screen effect to make it obvious boost was gained
Wind (volumes) / wind turbines

Levels (creative hazzards)
	City
	Sky
	Desert - sandstorms
	Factory
	Arctic - ice caves, falling ice
	Volcano - falling rocks, magma

Update level preview images
Ensure music is credited

### Bugs and stuff ###
Camera can clip with the gates, perhaps use a fading material when close...
What to do if a joystick disconnects in menu or game?

### Long Term ###
Leaderboard
tutorial
Level preview camera shots in menu
Ghosting
