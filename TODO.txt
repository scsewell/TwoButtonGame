How to Play

### Bugs and stuff ###
Outline is very expensive on UI, especially the player time...
Camera can clip with the gates, perhaps use a fading material when close...

### Long Term ###
Level preview camera shots in menu
Input selection
Player n is nth joiner (But what about if 1st player leaves?)
Leaderboard
Replays / Ghosting
