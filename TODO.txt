### To Do ###
Player Models (fatty, floating boosters fancy tech, robot, other race?, really abstract?)
Character blurbs
improve camera - more vertical smoothing than on horizontal plane

Player movement/boost sounds
Checkpoint sound
Player finish line sounds
Collision sound
Boost gate sounds
Waypoint move sound

Moving gates - Add rotation
Alternate gates
Boost gates - improve graphics
Wind / wind turbines

Levels
	City
	Sky
	Desert - sandstorms
	Factory
	Arctic - ice caves
	Volano
Handle level bounds (could done using a restoring force a little larger than the thrust force component going out of bound, visual effect or notification)

Make motion feel fast (radial speed blur, etc)

Ready up anim
Level preview camera shots in menu as well?
How to Play
Ensure music is credited

### Bugs and stuff ###
Outline is very expensive on UI, especially the player time...
Camera can clip with the gates, perhaps use a fading material when close...

### Long Term ###
Input selection
Player n is nth joiner (But what about if 1st player leaves?)
Leaderboard
Replays / Ghosting
