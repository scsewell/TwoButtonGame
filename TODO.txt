### To Do ###
Player Models (one fatty, one floating boosters fancy tech, robot, one other other race?, really abstract?)
Abilities and stuff

Boost gates - improve graphics
Moving gates - Add rotation (Gate thrusters that attatch to the side of existing gate models)
Start / finish line
Wind / wind turbines

Checkpoint sound
Collision sound
Player movement/action sounds
Player finish line sounds

Levels
	City
	Sky
	Desert - sandstorms
	Factory
	Arctic - ice caves
	Volano
Handle level bounds (could done using a restoring force a little larger than the thrust force component going out of bound, visual effect or notification)

Make motion feel fast (radial speed blur, etc)

Ready up anim
Level preview camera shots in menu as well?
How to Play
Ensure music is credited

### Bugs and stuff ###
Outline is very expensive on UI, especially the player time...
Camera can clip with the gates, perhaps use a fading material when close?
Can occasionally pass through gates?

### Maybe ###
Input selection
Player n is nth joiner (But what about if 1st player leaves?)
Leaderboard
Replays / Ghosting
