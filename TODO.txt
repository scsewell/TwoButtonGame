### To Do ###

Short Term
- Text Mesh Pro
- New Input sytstem (remove old Input system and framework controls)
- Custom logo intro (add setting / command line option to skip in settings)
- Make shnazzy outline for character select, with integrated name plate at botton, profile plate at top
	Arrows would be added to the character plate instead

- Use player color in 
- check for spaghetti (check singleton usage)
- things should not know about level stuff, only interact with race classes
- implement waypoint as a race concept, things should reference that instead
- turn race manager into a state machine

ECS/Unity Physics
- Make sure to gut Physx as much as possible
- Any math transformation of inputs must be done in burst compiled code... otherwise determinism will not work
- Ensure physics update order is deterministic

Optimization
- Add profiling markers at useful locations
- Racer movement probably can be optimized
- Gate engine is very expensive for many objects
- UI code creates quite a bit of garbage
- There are quite a few Linq calls which can be removed
- Cinemachine/Replay cameras should be disabled when not used
- Investigate loading scenes as async with every object disabled and manually activating just a few objects per frame
- Add pre-awake to def. Create array of objects to call pre-awake on at build time per scene
- Unload scenes by disabling all objects in them and destroying just a few of the objects per frame

Migrate to URP
- gate color should be a global shader property, instead of hooking into OnWillRenderObject

General
- Rumble controller on impact
- Add character color options
- Outline is very expensive on UI, especially the player time... (check none are left)
- Difiiculy setting for levels - gate size differs based on difficulty (remove LevelConfig difficulty)
- Show player names above heads (fade in when close)
- Change down input from drag to hover? (might be much easier)
- look around (right josystick, don't know about keyboard though...)
- better guide to next waypoint (make waypoint color glow more obvious, improve direction arrow (racing line?), look at next gate button)
- end of race stats menu (laps speeds, time in lead, etc)
- Add goals for players to achieve per level

Replays
- View replays up to current time in race when paused
- Variable replay speed
- Allow changing cameras (cinemachine, chase camera, players all at once, players single (cycle through), manual zoom/free camera)
- Toggle menu display for nice screenshots/video

Audio
- Add 3D sound for splitscreen (virtual scene for audio, duplicate audio sorce for each listener)
- Add support for sound mixing in audio manager
- Collision/sliding sound
- Player finish line sounds
- Energy gate sounds
- Waypoint engine sound
- Boost ready sound
- Full energy sound
- Victory music should differ from replay music

Characters
- Make animations more extreme
- Indicate boost ready on character
- paritcle motion trail behind racer engines (perhaps just other racers, helps see how they are moving when ahead)
- Engines spark/flash/pulse on boost fail because not enough energy
- (fatty, airbrake flaps!!!!, floating boosters fancy tech, robot, other race?, really abstract?)
- Abilities (down plummet, downwards boost, teleport)

AI
- Investigate ML agents

Levels
- Alternate paths
- need fancy visual effect for passing through a gate
- Moving gates with rotation along paths
- Improve boost gate graphics (animate the rings) - particles/screen effect to make it obvious boost was gained
- Wind zones

Level Ideas (try to think of creative hazzards)
- City
- Sky
- Desert (sandstorms)
- Factory
- Arctic (ice caves, falling ice)
- Volcano (falling rocks, magma)

### Bugs and stuff ###
black fade quad artifacts like crazy when app opens or alt-tabbing back to game window
Track preview appears on top of black fade quad
Camera can clip with the gates, perhaps use a fading material when close...
What to do if a joystick disconnects in menu or game?

### Long Term ###
