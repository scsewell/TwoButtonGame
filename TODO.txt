### To Do ###
Player Models (one fatty, one floating boosters fancy tech, robot, one other other race?, really abstract?)
Test levels
Music can play while paused during intro, while that behavior is only really wanted during race
pause player updates once , unpause snaps camera a little one out of 5 or so times
Make 2nd next gate white or so
Level Intro Music
Handle level bounds

Waypoint Gates (mulitple shapes and sizes)
Start / finish line gates
Boost gates
Moving gates
Wind / wind turbines

Abilities and stuff

Checkpoint sound
Collision sound
Player movement/action sounds
Player finish line sounds

Make motion feel fast (radial speed blur, etc)

Ready up anim
Level preview camera shots in menu as well?
How to Play
Ensure music is credited

### Bugs and stuff ###
Outline is very expensive on UI, especially the player time...
Camera can clip with the gates, perhaps use a fading material when close?

### Maybe ###
Input selection
Player n is nth joiner (But what about if 1st player leaves?)
Leaderboard
Replays / Ghosting
